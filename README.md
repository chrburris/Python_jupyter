# Python Self-Taught Projects

## repo content
Various .ipynb notebooks of small tasks and projects from a Udemy course in python. 

## Overview of this repo

Back in 2017 I decided to teach myself how to program in python. With languages such as Matlab, Mathematica, and R already under my belt, I sought out an intermediate course that would provide the foundation for me to tackle a broader range of challenges (those outside of mathematics and engineering). 

After trying out a few different options, I landed on taking a couple of Udemy courses which can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) and [here](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/).

What I appreciated most about these two courses was interfacing with jupyter notebooks. 

## Course Content

Although the course content is available in the links provided above, I'll showcase some of the skills I found to be the most useful / enlightening. 

* Intro to various data structures: Trees, dictionaries, graphs, etc.
  * This seems simple, but when I was working primarily with Matlab, it's easy to get stuck in the mindset that matrices (lists) are the only usable data type. 
* Search algorithms
  * Most useful for obvious reasons
